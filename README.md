# GrunnSpeedrunTimer

This a simple mod for grunn that adds a speedrun timer to the top of your screen. It also displays milliseconds (3 decimals) in the ending screen. Im working on making a live display of milliseconds right now as well.

# Installation
1. Download the latest stable release of BepInEx (*not* a pre-release one): https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases. The file should read something like "BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2.zip".
2. Download the .dll file from the releases tab of this repository (https://github.com/SushiRoll55/GrunnSpeedrunTimer/releases).
3. Unzip the contents of BepInEx into wherever your game executable is. To find it, right click Grunn on Steam, click manage, click browse local files, and open the folder called "Grunn". The game executable should be inside there.
4. Run the game once and then close it.
5. Open the "BepInEx" folder in your game's directory.
6. Place the "GrunnSpeedrunTimer.dll" you downloaded earlier inside the "plugins" folder.
7. Run the game.
