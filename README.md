# GrunnSpeedrunTimer

This a simple mod for grunn that adds a speedrun timer to the top of your screen. It also displays milliseconds (3 decimals) in the ending screen. Im working on making a live display of milliseconds right now as well.

## Installation
1. Download the latest stable release of BepInEx [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) (The file should read something like "BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2.zip").
2. Download the .dll file from the releases tab of this repository [here](https://github.com/SushiRoll55/GrunnSpeedrunTimer/releases).
3. In Steam, right click Grunn from the list of games of the left, hover over manage, click browse local files, and open the folder called "Grunn".
4. Unzip the contents of the BepInEx zip file into this folder.
5. Run the game once and then close it (no need to wait for the title screen to load).
6. Open the "BepInEx" folder in your game's directory.
7. Place the "GrunnSpeedrunTimer.dll" you downloaded earlier inside the "plugins" folder.
8. Run the game.
